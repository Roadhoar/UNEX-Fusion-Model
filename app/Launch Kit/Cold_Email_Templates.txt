Subject: Adaptive Fusion Confinement Model Ready for Testing (Q > 1.5 Sim Results)

Hi [Dr. Name],

Iâ€™m reaching out to share a new real-time plasma confinement modelâ€”UN-EXâ€”that simulates Q > 1.5 by leveraging harmonic-entropy feedback and shows strong alignment with Internal Transport Barrier behavior.

The simulation is public and interactive:

A full technical assessment is attached (PDF). Iâ€™d welcome the opportunity to collaborate or discuss potential validation pathways in your facility.

Best regards,

Subject: Net-Positive Fusion Simulation â€” Seeking Strategic Partner

Hi [Investor Name],

Iâ€™ve built a novel simulation model showing real-time, adaptive confinement of fusion plasmaâ€”achieving net-positive output (Q > 1.5) using entropy feedback and harmonic injection. It outperforms classical models and is fully testable with existing hardware.

Try the interactive model here:

I'm seeking partners for the next phase: validation, funding, and deployment.

Subject: Proposal for Real-Time Fusion Confinement Optimization (UN-EX Model)

Dear [Program Officer],

Iâ€™m submitting a proposal for a new experimental fusion framework. The UN-EX model uses entropy-harmonic feedback to confine plasma, achieving Q > 1.5 in simulation. Itâ€™s rooted in established diagnostics and control systems, and ready for lab testing.

The one-pager PDF is attached. Live demo here:

Looking forward to your guidance and interest.

Sincerely,  
Josh Chesher
