🚨 Fusion researchers, physicists, and innovators — I need your eyes on this.

I’ve built a simulation model that uses entropy-harmonic feedback to confine plasma in real time. It achieves Q > 1.5, outperforms Bohm diffusion, and mimics ITB behavior found in tokamak experiments.

It’s live. It’s interactive. And it’s ready for testing:

1/ I built a real-time plasma confinement sim that achieves Q > 1.5.  
2/ It uses entropy-harmonic feedback to suppress turbulence.  
3/ It outperforms Bohm scaling.  
4/ It’s live, public, and testable with real lab gear.

I developed a real-time simulation for plasma confinement using entropy-harmonic feedback. It shows net-positive energy (Q > 1.5), suppresses turbulence, and models ITB-like behavior.

It’s physically valid, testable with CECE/reflectometry, and interactive:

Looking for validation partners, feedback, and funders.
